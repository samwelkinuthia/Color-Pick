A simple color guessing game where you try to guess a color based on it's RGB (Red, Green, Blue) value.
Try it out. [Demo](https://samwelkinuthia.github.io/Color-Pick/)

# How to Play

When the page loads, you see an rgb value and 6 color squares. One of the squares has the color displayed in the RGB value.

Lets try our luck by clicking square.

#### oops.. Wrong color

![wrong](img/wrong.png)

When a wrong color is clicked, the square disappears and a red ugly WRONG is shown.
Clicking wrong squares causes them to disapper but clicking on the right one does something interesting..

#### yaay..We got it right!

All squares reappear and change color to the right color, the title background changes color as well.

The default mode is the hard mode with six squares. The easy mode however, reduces the number to three.
